##PROBLEM STATEMENT: <br />We need our days to be well planned. We need an app that look after us. It reminds us for our pending work, <br />for upcoming meetings, 
                   and also alarm us for the deadline.

##SOLUTION: This is where the need for an android application kicks in. An application which allows us to keep track of things, <br />and make us aware about our upcoming deadline. 
          Hence I have tried to make an android applcation using [ANDROID STUDIO.](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) <br />It will not only support notes having texts           but will also support images to be added in notes.
          <br /> Here are some screenshots of this application. <br />
